# Mobile Application Development - Calorie Management Application

##Summary
I have have created a Fully working Calorie Application using the Ionic/Angular Framework.
and have opted for a more a Visual but functional approach, that not only included information regarding calories for food, but also allows a user to add up each food item consumed using buttons to increment each quantity, which in turn adds up the calories for each food and finally, gives a summary of the total calories consumed within a given day. 

##Branch information:
There are 3 branches;
	*Master - The original master, forked from your repostitory
	*branch1 - My Branch that contained my original project development path
	*branch2 - A new branch that contained a new project path. (Contains the Final Commit, "Final Project Version")

For the structure of my application, i have an image resource folder, an index.html, a css folder with custom styles
and a js folder that contains an app.js, controllers.js and a services.js file. 

##Instructions for Use:
Open as usual with a text editor and run locally or remotely using the putty method. 
The Page will appear and the user will be prompted for the following;
	*First Name
	*Last Name
	*Gender
	*Day of the Week	

Note: A tick mark will appear on either Gender or Day of the Week, but not both. However the selection has been stored
for each one. After entering in this information, the user can scroll down and look at the various food types and will
have the option to Click a plus or minus button within each food group. After adding up that days calorie intake, 
the user can scroll down to the Summary section at the footer of the page. 
The Summary will show the details previously entered at the start, plus the total calories calculated by the users 
entries throughout the application.
